    top of the punch.

    To activate auto completion, use:

        eval "$(_PUNCHBOX_COMPLETE=source punchbox)"

    Two set of commands are available. The one under 'workspace' are the ones you are most likely
    to use. They let you build a workspace folder to configure what you need and deploy your punch.

    The ones under 'generate' are finer grain commands to selectively generate some of
    the configuration files.

    A good starting point is to type 'punchbox workspace create'
