# the PunchBox

Welcome to the punhcbox tool. This project is the successor of the 
https://github.com/punchplatform/punchbox project. We plan to make it
the official tool to deploy various sort of punch: standalone, production,
or even hybrids. 

This project uses [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
To run it simply type in : 

```sh
poetry run python punchbox.py
```

Should you miss some dependencies,
```sh
poetry install
```

## Use Guide

The punchbox requires you have a punchplatform-deployer package.
